# CS410: Rust Programming Course Project

## CuteDogStash
CuteDogStash is going to be an open source single-page application for storing posts of dogs. 
Using Yew and Trunk, rust code will be bundled into HTML, Javascript, and WebAssembly to run in browsers. 
Users will be able to post pictures and descriptions which will persist through localstorage.
